make a bid pseudocode:

firstMove = player1
targetSquare = rand(targetSquares[nextInt])
int bid = 0
timer = 100

if userSelect == "Save Game"
	saveGame()
	exit()
else if userSelect == "Reset Game"
	resetGame()
else if userSelect == "Exit Game"
	exit()
else
	firstBid = user inputs first bid
	startTimer()
	while(timer > 0)
		secondBid = player2's bid
		thirdBid = player3's bid
		fourthBid = player4's bid
		timer-- 
	for each player
		calculate shortest path to target square
		check shortest path against the bid
		determine who's bid was most accurate
		return winner 
	if winner == player1
		moveRobotPiece1(targetSquare)
	else if winner == player2
		moveRobotPiece2(targetSquare)
	else if winner == player3
		moveRobotPiece3(targetSquare)
	else if winner == player4
		moveRobotPiece4(targetSquare)
	else
		print("This round had no winner")
