Move the Robot Pseudocode (For a Simple Board)

Once a winner has been determined from the bidding process...

The system selects the winner's robot, and has a recorded path of where the robot needs to go. 

The system then moves the robot to one square along the path

The system displays the robot in the new square for the user and waits a couple of seconds.

Then the system moves the robot to another square along the path, then displays the robot to the user and waits a couple of seconds. 

This repeats until the robot gets to the target square.
