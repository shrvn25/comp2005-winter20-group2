/**
 * This class describes a square on a game board (used for both simple and complex). It has a row and column location on the
 * board (where top left has row col coordinate as (0, 0), top right corner has (0, 15), bottom right corner has
 * (15, 15), and bottom left corner has (15, 0). The square also has a list of what items are currently "on" it
 * in a list, where certain indices are given designated slots for different types of Java objects.
 * It also records if it has an edge barrier that a robot can't pass through, or a diagonal
 * barrier that some robots can pass through (note that two square adjacent to each other that have a edge barrier in between
 * them, have a recorded edge barrier on opposite sides of each other.) Square can also tell you if there is a target
 * tile on it and what that tile is,  and if there is a robot on it, and what that robot is.
 *
 * A square can also tell a robot or use if they can move in a certain direction if the user or robot tells them
 * what direction they want to move.
